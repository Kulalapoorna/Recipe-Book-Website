•500g mutton or chicken<br>
•2 large onions, thinly sliced<br>
•2 tomatoes, chopped<br>
•1/2 cup plain yogurt<br>
•2-3 green chilies, slit<br>
•2-3 cloves of garlic, minced<br>

Instructions:<br>
<br>                    
1.Wash and soak the Basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.<br>
                    
2.In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the soaked rice along with the whole spices and salt.<br>
Cook until the rice is partially done (it should still have a bite). Drain and set aside.<br>
                    
3.In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove some for garnishing.<br>
                    
4.Add the minced ginger, garlic, green chilies, and chopped tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil separates.<br>
                    
5.Add your choice of meat and cook until it changes color.<br>
                    
6.Add yogurt, mint leaves, and half of the coriander leaves. Stir well and cook for a few minutes.<br>
                    
7.Sprinkle ground spices (turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala), salt, and sugar. Mix well.<br>
                    
8.Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture.<br>
                    
9.Place a layer of saffron strands soaked in warm milk for color and flavor.<br>
                    
10.Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to trap steam.<br>
                    
11.Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and the meat is tender.<br>
                    
12.Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, garnish with fried onions and the remaining coriander leaves, and serve hot.<br>
